longDescription: It all started when I was about to be productive, I was struck by an insane tiredness that can only be explained as boredom. In the heat of the moment a decision had to be made, give up on being productive for the day, or do something only slightly productive.

## Introduction
A lot has happened during 2021, from being very comfortable in Canberra and looking for work gradually while working my retail job and then my lease ended abruptly, plans fell through and waiting almost four months between borders waiting for lockdowns to end so I could move to Brisbane in QLD. I might describe the year in more detail in a different blog post, but for now this post is to introduce my blog page and list off some of the stuff I've done this year during my free time.

### Blog
Towards the end of 2021, a few people I was talking to mentioned they started a blog, talking about projects, and how it often helped them work out future projects. I was quite bored around this time, and used it as an opportunity to work out how to make my own blog. I'd use the opportunity to learn a bit more Nuxt and take the chance to reflect on my previous projects for the year in an attempt to hopefully show that I was productive during the year.

## Projects
I've worked on a few different things this year, usually out of boredom and an attempt to learn new things but in no particular order.
- Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) for my website to allow ~~lazier~~ easier updates. 
- Component for landing page to make obvious that it uses [CI/CD](https://github.com/SimplyJpk/MyPortfolio/commit/9d52b62880b13f6f61a78b774f8dfb87bbb6f7d0).
- Had a crack at [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) and made a simple [solar system](https://JamesKellie.dev/projects/fun/simpleorbit) thing.
- Implemented a simple blog out of dire boredom that I'm sure no one will read. (Welcome)
- Took a technical challenge a little far and used OpenGL to make a [Match3](https://github.com/SimplyJpk/Match3) game
- Started a couple small projects with no real purpose other than to learn some things.
  - A very crude endless runner on a rotating ball within Unity to learn mobile inputs.
  - Experimented with Android Studio for the first time with mixed results. [AlarmClock](https://JamesKellie.dev/images/blog/projects-of-2021/AndroidStudioAlarmClock.png)
  - Continued work on [PixelProject](https://github.com/SimplyJpk/PixelProject) a "Falling Sand" type game made with C++, inspired by [Noita](https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/).
  - While not really educational I made a pointless website in an hour as an inside joke [EverythingWrongWithTheWorld](https://everythingwrongwiththeworld.com/)
  - Helped add features to a community bot [UDC Bot](https://github.com/Unity-Developer-Community/UDC-Bot) for a game dev Discord Community.
  - Discovered and added new gifs to my landing page for my [portfolio](https://jameskellie.dev/) from projects over 8 years old.
  - Met some interesting individuals during interviews for jobs, and while none (thus far) have led to employment, I've grown to become more confident in what I do and don't know which is always a big bonus.

Other than the blog that I've decided to start, one of my current projects is remaking a 1942 clone game I made for an old assignment 6+ years ago, but in Unity. I'll hopefully make it more Mobile friendly, which is the reason for a wider aspect ratio, it is still quite early and in need of more work.

A gallery of some of the stuff I've worked on this year, should be noted this gallery uses a component made with nuxt, still needs a bit of work to display better. If the images layout bellow isn't weird, I must have fixed it by now.

This has been my first blog, here is hoping it continues and isn't the only post I make.
