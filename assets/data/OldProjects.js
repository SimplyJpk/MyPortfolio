        'A small assignment for my Year 12 final project in Software design and development, it was made using VB.net with forms. A very impractical solution for making a game. It did work within a limited capacity, and I was the only student to score 100% for the assignment. The game could support up to 8 players, buying/trading was possible, the game did not have any AI.',
        'It should be noted that this project was made when I was 17-18 and my interest in programming was more "haha, this is stupid" and not so much "This is a serious attempt at something I may show off someday."',
        'These images are probably the oldest programming related content I have thanks to a dead HDD, these just so happened to still be on a very old USB.'

    funFact: 'The game had a rotating earth in the background. I do not remember where I pulled this from, but it was a screen recording converted into frames since I could not get a video to play.'
